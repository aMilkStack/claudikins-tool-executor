  This tool calls the Actor "apify/rag-web-browser" and retrieves its output results.

  Use this tool instead of the "call-actor" if user requests this specific Actor.

  Actor description: Web browser for OpenAI Assistants, RAG pipelines, or AI agents, similar to a web browser in
  ChatGPT. It queries Google Search, scrapes the top N pages, and returns their content as Markdown for further
  processing by an LLM. It can also scrape individual URLs.Use this tool when user wants to GET or RETRIEVE actual data
  immediately (one-time data retrieval).

  This tool directly fetches and returns data - it does NOT just find tools.


  Examples of when to use:

  - User wants current/immediate data (e.g., "Get flight prices for tomorrow", "What's the weather today?")

  - User needs to fetch specific content now (e.g., "Fetch news articles from CNN", "Get product info from Amazon")

  - User has time indicators like "today", "current", "latest", "recent", "now"


  This is for general web scraping and immediate data needs. For repeated/scheduled scraping of specific platforms
  (e-commerce, social media), consider suggesting a specialized Actor from the Store for better performance and
  reliability.
