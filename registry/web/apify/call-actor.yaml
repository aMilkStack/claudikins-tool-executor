  Call any Actor from the Apify Store using a mandatory two-step workflow.

  This ensures you first get the Actor’s input schema and details before executing it safely.


  There are two ways to run Actors:

  1. Dedicated Actor tools (e.g., apify-slash-rag-web-browser): These are pre-configured tools, offering a simpler and
  more direct experience.

  2. Generic call-actor tool (call-actor): Use this when a dedicated tool is not available or when you want to run any
  Actor dynamically. This tool is especially useful if you do not want to add specific tools or your client does not
  support dynamic tool registration.


  **Important:**


  Typically, a successful run returns a `datasetId` (the Actor's output stored as an Apify dataset) and a short preview
  of items.

  To fetch the full output, use the get-actor-output tool with the `datasetId`.


  USAGE:

  - Always use dedicated tools when available (e.g., apify-slash-rag-web-browser)

  - Use the generic call-actor tool only if a dedicated tool does not exist for your Actor.


  MANDATORY TWO-STEP-WORKFLOW:

  Step 1: Get Actor Info (step="info", default)

  - First call this tool with step="info" to get Actor details and input schema

  - This returns the Actor description, documentation, and required input schema

  - You MUST do this step first - it's required to understand how to call the Actor


  Step 2: Call Actor (step="call")

  - Only after step 1, call this tool again with step="call" and proper input based on the schema

  - This runs the Actor. It will create an output as an Apify dataset (with datasetId).

  - This step returns a dataset preview, typically JSON-formatted tabular data.


  EXAMPLES:

  - user_input: Get instagram posts using apify/instagram-scraper
inputSchema:
  type: object
  properties:
    actor:
      type: string
      description: The name of the Actor to call. For example, "apify/rag-web-browser".
    step:
      type: string
      enum:
        - info
        - call
      description: >-
        Step to perform: "info" to get Actor details and input schema (required first step), "call" to run the Actor
        (only after getting info).
    input:
      description: >-
        The input JSON to pass to the Actor. For example, {"query": "apify", "maxResults": 5}. Must be used only when
        step="call".

            Memory allocation for the Actor in MB. Must be a power of 2 (e.g., 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192,
            16384, 32768). Minimum: 128 MB, Maximum: 32768 MB (32 GB).

        timeout:
          description: >-
            Maximum runtime for the Actor in seconds. After this time elapses, the Actor will be automatically
            terminated. Use 0 for infinite timeout (no time limit). Minimum: 0 seconds (infinite).
