  Search Apify and Crawlee documentation using full-text search.

  You must explicitly select which documentation source to search using the docSource parameter:

  • docSource="apify" - Apify:
    Apify Platform documentation including: Platform features, SDKs (JS, Python), CLI, REST API, Academy (web scraping fundamentals), Actor development and deployment

  • docSource="crawlee-js" - Crawlee (JavaScript):
    Crawlee is a web scraping library for JavaScript. It handles blocking, crawling, proxies, and browsers for you.

  • docSource="crawlee-py" - Crawlee (Python):
    Crawlee is a web scraping library for Python. It handles blocking, crawling, proxies, and browsers for you.

  The results will include the URL of the documentation page (which may include an anchor),
  and a limited piece of content that matches the search query.

  Fetch the full content of the document using the fetch-apify-docs tool by providing the URL.
