  Dangerous — requires explicit user confirmation.

  ## Confirmation Workflow
  1) User requests removal ("Remove the React notebook")
  2) Look up full name to confirm
  3) Ask: "Remove '[notebook_name]' from your library? (Does not delete the actual NotebookLM notebook)"
  4) Only on explicit "Yes" → call remove_notebook

  Never remove without permission or based on assumptions.

  Example:
  User: "Delete the old React notebook"
  You: "Remove 'React Best Practices' from your library?"
  User: "Yes" → call remove_notebook
