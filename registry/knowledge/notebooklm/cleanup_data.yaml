  ULTRATHINK Deep Cleanup - Scans entire system for ALL NotebookLM MCP data files across 8 categories. Always runs in
  deep mode, shows categorized preview before deletion.


  ⚠️ CRITICAL: Close ALL Chrome/Chromium instances BEFORE running this tool! Open browsers can prevent cleanup and cause
  issues.


  Categories scanned:

  1. Legacy Installation (notebooklm-mcp-nodejs) - Old paths with -nodejs suffix

  2. Current Installation (notebooklm-mcp) - Active data, browser profiles, library

  3. NPM/NPX Cache - Cached installations from npx

  4. Claude CLI MCP Logs - MCP server logs from Claude CLI

  5. Temporary Backups - Backup directories in system temp

  6. Claude Projects Cache - Project-specific cache (optional)

  7. Editor Logs (Cursor/VSCode) - MCP logs from code editors (optional)

  8. Trash Files - Deleted notebooklm files in system trash (optional)


  Works cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS). Safe by design: shows detailed preview before deletion, requires
  explicit confirmation.


  LIBRARY PRESERVATION: Set preserve_library=true to keep your notebook library.json file while cleaning everything
  else.


  RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW for fresh start:

  1. Ask user to close ALL Chrome/Chromium instances

  2. Run cleanup_data(confirm=false, preserve_library=true) to preview

  3. Run cleanup_data(confirm=true, preserve_library=true) to execute

  4. Run setup_auth or re_auth for fresh browser session


  Use cases: Clean reinstall, troubleshooting auth issues, removing all traces before uninstall, cleaning old browser
  sessions and installation data.
