  PERMISSION REQUIRED — Only when user explicitly asks to add a notebook.

  ## Conversation Workflow (Mandatory)
  When the user says: "I have a NotebookLM with X"

  1) Ask URL: "What is the NotebookLM URL?"
  2) Ask content: "What knowledge is inside?" (1–2 sentences)
  3) Ask topics: "Which topics does it cover?" (3–5)
  4) Ask use cases: "When should we consult it?"
  5) Propose metadata and confirm:
     - Name: [suggested]
     - Description: [from user]
     - Topics: [list]
     - Use cases: [list]
     "Add it to your library now?"
  6) Only after explicit "Yes" → call this tool

  ## Rules
  - Do not add without user permission
  - Do not guess metadata — ask concisely
  - Confirm summary before calling the tool

  ## Example
  User: "I have a notebook with n8n docs"
  You: Ask URL → content → topics → use cases; propose summary
  User: "Yes"
  You: Call add_notebook
