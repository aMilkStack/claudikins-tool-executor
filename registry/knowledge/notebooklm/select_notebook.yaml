server: notebooklm

description: |-
  Set a notebook as the active default (used when ask_question has no notebook_id).

  ## When To Use
  - User switches context: "Let's work on React now"
  - User asks explicitly to activate a notebook
  - Obvious task change requires another notebook

  ## Auto-Switching
  - Safe to auto-switch if the context is clear and you announce it:
    "Switching to React notebook for this task..."
  - If ambiguous, ask: "Switch to [notebook] for this task?"

  ## Example
  User: "Now let's build the React frontend"
  You: "Switching to React notebook..." (call select_notebook)
