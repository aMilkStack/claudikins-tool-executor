  Use this tool to get a high-level understanding of the code symbols in a file.
  This should be the first tool to call when you want to understand a new file, unless you already know
  what you are looking for. Returns a JSON object containing symbols grouped by kind in a compact format.
inputSchema:
  type: object
  properties:
    relative_path:
      title: Relative Path
      type: string
      description: The relative path to the file to get the overview of.
    depth:
      default: 0
      title: Depth
      type: integer
      description: |-
        Depth up to which descendants of top-level symbols shall be retrieved
        (e.g. 1 retrieves immediate children). Default 0.
    max_answer_chars:
      default: -1
      title: Max Answer Chars
      type: integer
      description: |-
        If the overview is longer than this number of characters,
        no content will be returned. -1 means the default value from the config will be used.
        Don't adjust unless there is really no other way to get the content required for the task.
